        <p>The above chart illustrates the total non-citizen population of the United States as of 2021. Interestingly, White non-citizens make up the vast majority of the non-citizen population. Given that the total population of the United States is also overwhelmed by a White majority, it is reasonable to assume that this data is merely a reflection of that. In reality, then, it is not that there is a disproportionate amount of White non-citizens in the United States—it is that there is a disproportionate amount of White people in the total population.</p>
       
        <p>Similarly, the relatively small percentage of Native Americans and Native Hawaiians could be attributed to the total population of those races also being relatively small compared to others.
       
        The amount of Asian non-citizens and non-citizens with some other race (depicted as ‘Other’), however, are nearly equal, each respectively making up a quarter of the total non-citizens in the United States in 2021. Most likely, the majority of individuals listed under the ‘Other’ category are Hispanic or Latino, which is no longer categorized as a race by the United States Census Bureau. Instead, it is considered an ethnicity.</p>

        <p>This chart, on the other hand, displays the total population of each race in the United States as of 2021. Then, nestled within the larger total population, one may view the proportion of non-citizens to citizens, In every instance, there are far more citizens than non-citizens. This displays this information in a new light. While there are millions of non-citizens in the United States, their numbers are far outweighed by the number of total citizens. </p>
